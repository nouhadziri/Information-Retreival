Lionel Carpenter is a night-school teacher who has bad luck with women. He remains a virgin until his brash cousin Danny  sets him up with a one-night stand. Soon after, Lionel starts feeling nauseous and throwing up, eventually doing so onto Segoynia Savaka , one of his immigrant students. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise, as it gives him an excuse to ask her out on a date, and a romance develops. When Lionel meets Segoynia's fortune-telling grandmother , she intuits that he is the world's first pregnant man. This results in a series of gags relating to his pregnancy and people's reactions to it. One sideplot has Lionel being pursued by the army, as the president is afraid of what effect the widespread ability of men to conceive will have on population growth. In the ending sequence, which is patterned after the Nativity, Lionel finally goes into labor. The camera rises to heaven where God announces to the viewers the successful delivery: "Oh my god... it's a girl!"
