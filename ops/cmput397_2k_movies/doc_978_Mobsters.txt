{{Expand section}} This highly dramatized film, focuses primarily on Luciano and Lansky. They start as young men victimized by the current mafia. They rise from petty criminals and bootleggers to push aside the old guard of the Mafia and eventually establish The Commission, which set up the New York Mafia into five separate families. Bugsy Siegel  and Frank Costello  control the physical elements of the operation, while Lucky Luciano  and Meyer Lansky  bring up the business end.{{cite web}}
