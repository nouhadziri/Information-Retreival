{{Plot}} The movie starts out with Lucky the Dog  explaining John Dolittle's  gift of talking to animals. John, who holds a great reputation, comes home from France and gives his wife a present from Paris while he was on talk shows and other things about his gift. He also gives his daughter, Maya , a chameleon, named Pepito, from Mexico. Also, Charisse's  sixteenth birthday is coming today, and John is angry because she decided to go out on a date when she was supposed to spend it at her house. She was also not doing well in her classes. As a punishment, her father takes her phone away. Later on, Charisse's boyfriend, Eric , comes over and decides to join the family at the birthday party. However, a possum  and a raccoon, Joey , tell the doctor that their boss, the Godbeaver, wants to see him. Reluctant, John decides to do so. He meets the Godbeaver  who shows him that the forest is being cut down. John plans to save the forest to get an endangered female Pacific Western bear together with a male to save their species though that is only if the male stays away from campsites and stores. He then only has one month to do it. At a circus, John attempts to get Archie, the surviving male member in his species, to go out into the forest to teach him to become a real bear and mate with the lone potential Pacific Western bear female, Ava. Reluctantly, he agrees but John knows that Archie, being separated from his mother when he was a cub, doesn't know what kind of bear he is and never acts as a real animal. Then, after taking his family on a vacation to the forest for the rest of the month, John makes a deal with Ava to not make any decisions for the month and promised to turn Archie into someone she will love to provide, hunt and protect for her when she has cubs, though she is already involved with someone else. While he unsuccessfully trains Archie, John hires the local forest creatures to make an attempt to stop Charisse and Eric from making out. But during the training, he ignores Lisa for the next few days. Then, John tells Archie that he will find a way win Ava's heart, despite Archie's doubts of facing Ava's Kodiak Bear boyfriend, Sonny. Then, every animal in the forest watches as John dances with Lisa, and as the two attempt to embrace, Lucky accidentally blows it, making John angrily getting the animals away from the cabin and Lisa dumps him by making him sleep on the couch, much to his chagrin. Then, Archie attempts to get Ava's attention by singing her a song while imitating John in a smooth voice and on a tree branch, but blows his attempt when he is too heavy for the branch to hold and he falls down, humiliating himself. Archie then refused to come out of his new-found cave because of humiliating himself in front of Ava and John gets him out by calling him a coward. Archie proclaims that it was hard but John knows how hard it is when his wife grows mad at him, Charisse growing mad at him too and spending his family vacation with a pizza delivery boy. Frustrated with John's insults, Archie hits John, making him fall on a muddy hole, and he begins to listen to his "inner bear". Later on, he spends the rest of the day with Ava, whose relationship with Sonny isn't very well. Then, Lucky then attempts to win the affection of an attractive female wolf . This attempt was successful as Lucky urinates around her territory and she is about to go out with him but one of her packmates came and finds Lucky urinating part of the pack's territory and they leave, much to Lucky's dismay. On the other hand, Ava is forced to leave Archie by Sonny . Afterwards, Mr. Potter, the owner of two logging companies, attempts to make a deal with John, and when Archie arrives, he tells John he has his "big finish", knowing that he will win Ava about John telling him to listen to his "inner bear". Back at the cabin, Charisse is beginning to hate living in the forest and is annoyed with her family talking to the animals, though John doesn't know what is bothering her. Meanwhile, Archie goes after a bee hive on a fallen tree at the edge of a tall hill, and despite commands from John and attacking bees, he manages to get the hive. Later, in a game of hide and seek with Ava , Archie is shot by a tranquilizer dart fired by Mr. Potter's apprentice. John later learns that Archie had somewhat destroyed the back of a restaurant in the woods. After getting information from a weasel  of what happened, John visits Archie in a jail and tells the bear that he may be too dangerous to be set free and is going to be sold to a Mexican circus. Then, John realizes that Charisse has developed her father's gift of talking to animals, though it has been in her for two weeks now. Later, John held a meeting for every animal in the forest to not give up without a fight no matter what kind of animal expression they have. Everyone agrees to do it in order to free Archie. The animals, led by Charisse, Eric, and Maya, rebel against the loggers and every animal around the world go on strikes as an effort to free Archie. Mr. Potter and his apprentice are then attacked by some of the animals at the company, such as a swarm of rats, a fleet of pigeons, a pack of wolves and Mr. Potter's apprentice is then attacked by the swarm of bees outside the building, while Mr. Potter is cornered by Ava and Joey. Then, when the animals refuse to have twelve acres in their home, the strike keeps growing . As a deal is made, the Dolittles and the animals have saved the entire forest outside of San Francisco. At the end, John and Charisse become closer while Archie and Ava mate and have cubs. ===Cast=== {| class="wikitable" !Actor !Role |- |Eddie Murphy |Dr. John Dolittle |- |Raven-Symoné |Charisse Dolittle |- |Jeffrey Jones |Joe Potter |- |Kevin Pollak |Riley |- |Kristen Wilson |Lisa Dolittle |- |- |Kyla Pratt |Maya Dolittle |- |Lil Zane |Eric  |- |Lawrence Pressman |Governor of California  |- |Steve Irwin |Cameo AppearanceHimself |} ===Animal Voice Cast=== {| class="wikitable" !Actor !Role !Animal |- |Steve Zahn |Archie |Pacific Western Bear |- |Norm Macdonald |Lucky |Dog |- |Lisa Kudrow |Ava |Pacific Western Bear |- |Mike Epps |Sonny |Kodiak Bear |- |Jacob Vargas |Pepito |Chameleon |- |Michael Rapaport |Joey |Raccoon |- |Phil Proctor |Drunk Monkey |Monkey |- |Isaac Hayes |Possum |Opossum |- |Andy Dick |Mr. "Lennie" Weasel |Weasel |- |John Witherspoon |Old Prison Bear |Bear |- |Cedric the Entertainer |Young Prison Bear |Bear |- |Jamie Kennedy |Dog #1 |Dog |- |David Cross |Dog #2 |Dog |- ||Bob Odenkirk |Dog #3 |Dog |- |David DeLuise |Fish #1 |Fish |- |Hal Sparks |Fish #2 |Fish |- |Reni SantoniCheech Marin  |Rat #1 |Rat |- |John Leguizamo |Rat #2 |Rat |- |Arnold Schwarzenegger |White Wolf |Wolf |- |Kevin Pollak |Alligator |Alligator |- |Georgia Engel |Giraffe |Giraffe |- |Joey Lauren Adams |Squirrel |Squirrel |- |Mandy Moore |Girl Bear Cub |Bear |- |Frankie Muniz |Boy Bear Cub |Bear |- |Michael McKean |Bird #1 |Bird |- |David L.
